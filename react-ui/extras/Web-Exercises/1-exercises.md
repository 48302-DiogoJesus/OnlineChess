# WEB Practice

## Intro

Here are some exercises to learn and practice web programming concepts, server-side and client-side.

Exercises:

1.  Safe dividing function + unit tests (with TS)
2.  Function to join strings or numbers (with TS)
3.  Implement a stack of type Book (with TS)
4.  Implement a generic stack (with TS)
5.  Function to extract an object from an API and extract a set of properties:

    - V1 - Return a promise
    - V2 - Use Async/Await

6.  Function to get an HTML page and extract it's title under the tag `<title></title>`
7.  Build an Express API with, at least, 4 routes (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT) that provides filtered information from another API
8.  Create a login form in HTML that submits the form data to your API (NodeJS Express):
    - V1 - client-side(HTML) & server-side(NodeJS Express API that allows login)
    - V2 - client-side(HTML & JS) & server-side(NodeJS Express API that allows login)
9.  Create a simple Socket.io chat app. Where 2 clients can chat through a socket connection managed by a NodeJS Express App. Server filters a set of bad words.
